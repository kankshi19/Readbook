<h1> CHAPTER 4 </h1>
<p>
The thump is heard again. 
A giant smashes down the door. Uncle Vernon threatens the giant with a gun, but the giant takes the gun and ties it into a knot. 
The giant presents Harry with a chocolate birthday cake and introduces himself as Hagrid, the “Keeper of Keys and Grounds at Hogwarts.” 
Hagrid is disturbed to find out that the Dursleys have never told Harry what Hogwarts is. 
Vernon tries to stop Hagrid from telling Harry about Hogwarts, but to no avail. Hagrid tells Harry that Harry is a wizard and presents him with a letter of acceptance to the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. 
Vernon protests that he will not allow Harry to attend Hogwarts. 
Hagrid explains to Harry that the Dursleys have been lying all along about how the boy’s parents died. 
Harry learns that they did not die in a car crash, as he had always thought, but were killed by the evil wizard Voldemort. 
Harry does not believe he could be a wizard, but then he realizes that the incident with the boa constrictor was an act of wizardry. 
With Uncle Vernon protesting, Hagrid takes Harry from the shack.</p>
